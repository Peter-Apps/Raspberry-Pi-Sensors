# Raspberry-Pi-Sensors
Connecting various sensors to a Raspberry Pi for use in classroom settings

1) Use Sense HAT to record tempreature & humidity data and upload to Google Sheets
2) Use Sense HAT to record angular displacement and velocities, save the files and graphs locally
3) Use Sense HAT to plot 3D magnetic field vectors, save the files and graphs locally
4) Create a photogate using a laser module and a phototresistor
5) Create a distance, velocity, and acceleration sensor using an ultrasonic ranger.
