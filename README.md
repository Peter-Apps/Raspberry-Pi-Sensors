# Raspberry-Pi-Sensors
Connecting various sensors to a Raspberry Pi for use in classroom settings

1) Weaather Station - Use Sense HAT to record tempreature & humidity data and upload to Google Sheets
2) Angular Graphs - Use Sense HAT to record angular displacement and velocities, save the files and graphs locally
3) Mag Fields - Use Sense HAT to plot 3D magnetic field vectors, save the files and graphs locally
4) Create a photogate using a laser module and a phototresistor
5) Range Sensor - Create a distance, velocity, and acceleration sensor using an ultrasonic ranger.
